# Network-hacking-tools

In this course we have learned about security issues in common protocols, as well as algorithms used to secure local, mobile and Internet networks.

We also studied types of algorithms that were created in order to achieve specific goals related to information security, concentrating on information transferring over the network.

This course provided a great deal of knowledge about security problems in networks, including the solutions of the problems. We have learned through lectures and exercises to exploit vulnerabilities or protect against them.
